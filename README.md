# FGC 2025 â€” Robot Prototype ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–

This repository is our very first prototype for the **First Global Challenge 2025**..  
We are **Team NeBusoku**, a group of coding beginners who came together during a summer camp.  
Through late nights, trial and error, and plenty of teamwork, we created these first lines of code.  

More than just a program, this prototype represents our journey of **learning, growth, and collaboration** as we take our first steps into robotics and global competition.
